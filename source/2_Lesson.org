- Virtual pets were very common and popular a few years ago.
- Pets such as the [[http:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi][Tamagotchi]] were tiny computers with software on them that simulated a pet.
- The owner of the pet had to feed it and pet it otherwise the pet would die.
- You're going to be making your own virtual pet in Scratch.
